# True-Evolution
A Javascript-based game (Works on desktop, mobile is playable but is pretty much alpha build.)

The purpose of the game is to survive as long as possible. If you collide with another animal you wll become the child of those two animals.
The new animal will have traits from both the parents. Traits are: speed, size, sound, special power.
Try to get bigger, faster and watch out for predators. Tip: kill off the predators as fast as possible. Creating a new animal will give you full health.

I created this game to learn about classes and objects. It ended up way bigger and time-consuming than i expected. It is one of the earlier projects in Javascript i did. Beware of possible bad code and commit messages.
Game is fully working on desktop but has problems on mobile at the moment.
